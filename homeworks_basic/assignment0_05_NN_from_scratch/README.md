Your ulitmate goal is to implement all the basic blocks of the neural network in pure numpy. All the code you need is available in the [week0_08 directory](https://github.com/girafe-ai/ml-mipt/tree/basic_f20/week0_08_Intro_to_DL). 

Please, implement the modules (layers, loss functions, optimizers, etc.) in the `modules.ipynb`. Two layers (`Conv2d` and `MaxPool2d`) are optional and will give you a bit more challenge (and more points of course).

You can use the [test_modules.ipynb](https://github.com/girafe-ai/ml-mipt/blob/basic_f20/week0_08_Intro_to_DL/test_modules.ipynb) notebook to test your code locally.

__To submit the assignment, convert your notebook with modules into `.py` file (File->Download as->Python (.py) in Jupyter) and upload it to the contest.__

P.s. You will need the implemented layers in the upcoming Lab 3 as well. 

Good luck!
